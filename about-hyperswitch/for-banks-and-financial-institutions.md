# üè¶ For banks & financial institutions

We believe that payments should become a basic utility like water or electricity. Hyperswitch is an effort towards increasing the accessibility, bridging diversity and reducing the cost involved in processing payments. One of the way this can be achieved is by enabling more merchants to directly connect with the banks to process payments.&#x20;

If you resonate with our mission, you can learn more about how you can join the movement as a financial institution !

## How can Hyperswitch be useful for your bank?

### Acquire more merchants for your bank's acquiring solution&#x20;

Your bank can self deploy Hyperswitch on your own infrastructure, whitelabel and start distributing to your merchants. With Hyperswitch, merchants could benefit by connecting to your bank's acquiring solution and at the same time access multiple payment methods including wallets, buy now pay later and many more.

Hyperswitch offer an out-of-the-box migration capability to seamlessly migrate merchant from Stripe to your bank's acquiring solution. So you do not have to worry about long integration lead times if your merchants are already integrated to Stripe.

### Unifying the diverse acquiring solutions within your bank

If you bank's acquiring technology is diversified with multiple technology solutions (may be due to recent acquisitions, or mergers, or any other reason) you can unify them all under Hyperswitch. And you will be able to self deploy Hyperswitch on your own infrastructure, whitelabel and start distributing to your merchants.&#x20;

This will significantly enhance the merchant onboarding experience and reduce the cost of managing multiple acquiring solutions within your bank.

## Next steps

Currently, Hyperswitch supports 50+ payment processors as connectors and we are in the process of adding more bank integrations. Because, we feel that if merchants directly connect to the bank it can help them reduce the cost of processing payments.
