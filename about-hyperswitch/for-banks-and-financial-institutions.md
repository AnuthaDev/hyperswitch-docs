We believe that payments should be a basic utility like water or electricity. Hyperswitch is an effort towards increasing the accessibility, bridging diversity and reducing the cost involved in processing payments. One of the ways this can be achieved is through direct integrations to the source as opposed to processing payments through a stack of intermediaries. If you resonate with this mission, you can learn more about how you can join the movement as a financial institution!

Today, Hyperswitch supports 50+ payment processors, payment methods and multiple payment flows. To get started, find the guide that best describes your payment use cases:
