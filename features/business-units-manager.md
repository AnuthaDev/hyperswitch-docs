  accounts in Hyperswitch

# ðŸ“Š Business units manager

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, we will cover the steps to create new business unit, attach connector to it, and send corresponding transactions.
{% endhint %}

When you sign up on Hyperswitch, we automatically create a business unit under your merchant\_id with the Business country as the country you selected during sign-up and Business Label as default. When you create a new processor account, it is automatically attached to this business unit. You would be able to configure one account for every processor/connector under one business unit.

List of connectors configured along with the business unit that they are attached to can be viewed under the Processors section on your Hyperswitch dashboard

## How to create a new Business unit?

Now, if you want to add more accounts from the same processor, you can create a new business unit under Settings -> Business Unit configuration on your Hyperswitch dashboard.&#x20;

If you have multiple business units, add them here by providing the country and a label for each unit.

\-For Eg: If you have clothing and shoe business units in both US & GB and the 'US clothing' unit has to be your default business unit, then create the following units:

* Country = US, label = default (created during signup if US was chosen as your country)
* Country = US, label = shoe
* Country = GB, label = clothing
* Country = GB, label = shoe

## How do I attach a connector to a new business unit?

After creating a second business unit apart from the default unit that was created during sign up, whenever you try to create a new connector you can select a business unit that the connector needs to be attached to by toggling the show advanced settings option.

## How do I send a transaction through a particular business unit in Hyperswitch?

If you have more than one business unit, you need to send the business\_country & business\_label fields during [payments/create API request](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/payments/payments--create). &#x20;

You would be able to see the Business Unit that each payment was processed through when you click on a payment in the Operations -> Payments section on your Hyperswitch dashboard.

## How do I set business unit specific routing rules?

If no business\_country and business\_label fields are included in the routing rules, the rules are applied to all business units. But if you want to restrict a rule to a particular business unit, you can include the business\_country and business\_label fields in your routing rule.&#x20;
