# üîÅ Saving payment methods & recurring payments

{% hint style="info" %}
This sections deals with the various ways in which you can save a payment method and how to use them in recurring payments
{% endhint %}

Hyperswitch supports the following ways of saving a payment method for future payments

1. Saving for future customer on-session payments (COF-CIT)
2. Saving for future customer off-session payments (MIT)
3. Saving with the creation of a mandate (India specific)

## :digit\_one: Saving a payment method for future on-session payments (COF CIT)

To improve conversion rates and eliminate friction for the customer during checkout, you can save the customer's card so that they wouldn't have to enter the card details every time. This is also minimises the risk of the customer entering incorrect card details.&#x20;

Saving for future on-session payments implies that the customer will be available online during the checkout and can authenticate the payment by entering CVV or complete 3DS verification. These are known as Card-on-File Customer Initiated Transactions (COF-CIT).

This is typically limited for card payment methods and not for wallets (viz. Apple Pay) and other APMs.

For saving a customer's payment method used in a successful transaction:

* Pass the following field in the `/payments` create request to indicate your intention to save the payment method

```bash
"setup_future_usage": "on_session"
```

* Pass the customer's consent to store the card in the `/payments/:id:/confirm` request

```bash
"customer_acceptance": {
        "acceptance_type": "online",
        "accepted_at": "1963-05-03T04:07:52.723Z",
        "online": {
            "ip_address": "in sit",
            "user_agent": "amet irure esse"
        }
    }
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using the Hyperswitch SDK, the `customer_acceptance` is sent in the `/payments/:id:/confirm` request on the basis of customer clicking the save card radio button

**Note:** Ensure to enable this functionality using the [_displaySavedPaymentMethodsCheckbox_](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-cloud/integration-guide/web/customization#id-6.-handle-saved-payment-methods) property during SDK integration
{% endhint %}

## :digit\_two: Saving a payment method for future MIT payments

Let's say, you want to save a customer's payment method to charge them at a later point without the need for additional cardholder authentication. This is done by raising an MIT (Merchant Initiated Transaction) exemption to the card network by the payment processor with reference to an initial transaction where the customer has authorised recurring charges. These are typically used when you want to charge a customer periodically/sporadically with a flexibility on the amount to be charged and number of charges.

Based on the payment processors support, this functionality is also available for other payment methods like Apple Pay and Google Pay Wallets.

### To save a customer's payment method used in a successful transaction for future MIT payments:

* Pass the following field in the `/payments` create request to indicate your intention to save the payment method

```bash
"setup_future_usage": "off_session"
```

* Pass the customer's consent to store the card in the `/payments/:id:/confirm` request

```bash
"customer_acceptance": {
        "acceptance_type": "online",
        "accepted_at": "1963-05-03T04:07:52.723Z",
        "online": {
            "ip_address": "in sit",
            "user_agent": "amet irure esse"
        }
    }
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using the Hyperswitch SDK, the `customer_acceptance` is sent in the `/payments/:id:/confirm` request on the basis of customer clicking the save card radio button

**Note:** Ensure to enable this functionality using the [_displaySavedPaymentMethodsCheckbox_](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-cloud/integration-guide/web/customization#id-6.-handle-saved-payment-methods) property during SDK integration
{% endhint %}

Retrieve the `payment_method_id` that was created against the above payment by retrieving the payment. You will get the payment\_method\_id in the response

```bash
curl --location 'https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io/payments/<pass the payment_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'api-key: <enter your Hyperswitch API key here>' \
```

### Making an MIT payment with a saved payment method

Once a customer's payment method is saved for MIT payments you can start charging the customer by sending the following details in the /payments request

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>"off_session": true,
</strong>"recurring_details": {
        "type": "payment_method_id",
        "data": "pm_lmTnIO5EdCiiMgRPrV9x" //pass the payment method id here
}
</code></pre>

## :digit\_three: Setting up a Mandate (India Specific)

You can set up a recurring payment by creating a mandate by passing the **mandate\_type** details under the **`mandate_data`** object and the **`setup_future_usage`** field with value as ‚Äòoff\_session‚Äô during payments-create API request.

Our Unified checkout takes care of the remaining mandate creation process by showing the customers a mandate acceptance form, during payment, that explicitly gathers their permission to store and charge their payment method later. The required data for the **customer\_acceptance** object under the **mandate\_data** object in payments API is also automatically gathered by our Unified checkout and passed to the Hyperswitch backend.

On successful mandate creation, a **`mandate_id`** is generated against the payment and this can be found in your dashboard.

### Executing Recurring Mandate Transactions

Once you have the **mandate\_id**, you can pass the **mandate\_id** in payments/create API requests along with the **`off_session`** field as ‚Äòtrue‚Äô and ‚Äò**`confirm`**‚Äô as ‚Äòtrue‚Äô from your server when you want to charge your customer later when they are not present in your checkout flow.

Your customers‚Äô payment method would be charged automatically in most cases without any Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) prompts. In case your customers are required to perform a SCA authentication by the processor, Hyperswitch will transition the payment‚Äôs status to ‚Äòrequires\_customer\_action‚Äô state and you would need to notify your customer to come to the checkout flow to complete the authentication and payment.

### Try creating a Mandate/Recurring payment on Hyperswitch

#### **1.  Create a mandate payment from your server:**&#x20;

Make a request to the [payments](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/payments/payments--create) endpoint with **`mandate_data`** object along with other necessary fields  (**`amount, currency, payment_method, payment_method_type, payment_method_data`**) and **`confirm=true`**

**Sample curl:**

```bash
curl --location 'https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io/payments' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'api-key: <your-hyperswitch-api-key>' \
--data '{
    "amount": 6540,
    "currency": "USD",
    "confirm": false,
    "customer_id":"StripeCustomer123",
    "authentication_type": "no_three_ds",
    "setup_future_usage": "off_session",
    "mandate_data": {
        "mandate_type": {
            "single_use": {
                "amount": 7000,
                "currency": "USD"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### **2.  Confirm the mandate payment after collecting payment\_method\_data and customer\_acceptance from Unified checkout**

**Collect payment method information like card number or bank account number along with an acceptance from the customer stating that you would be storing their payment method details and charging them later even if they aren't in the flow. Pass these information in payments/confirm API. If you're using Unified checkout, this is taken care by it automatically.**

**Sample curl:**

````bash
curl --location 'https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io/payments/<original_payment_id>/confirm' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'api-key: <your_publishable_key>' \
--data '{
    "client_secret": "<client_secret_of_the_original_payment>",
    "payment_method": "card",
    "payment_method_data": {
        "card": {
            "card_number": "4242424242424242",
            "card_exp_month": "10",
            "card_exp_year": "25",
            "card_holder_name": "joseph Doe",
            "card_cvc": "123"
        }
    },
    "mandate_data": {
        "customer_acceptance": {
            "acceptance_type": "online",
            "accepted_at": "2023-11-03T04:07:52.723Z",
            "online": {
                "ip_address": "127.0.0.1",
                "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
            }
        }
    }
}'
```
````

#### 3. Make a recurring payment from your server by passing mandate\_id and off\_session fields:

Once you've created a mandate, store the `mandate_id` from the previous step. Whenever you want to make a recurring payment against the customer, pass the `mandate_id` in payments/create request along with:

* `off_session=true` to indicate that the customer is not in the flow&#x20;
* `confirm=true` to confirm the payment in one-step

````bash
curl --location 'https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io/payments' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'api-key: <your_api_key>' \
--data '{
    "amount": 6540,
    "currency": "USD",
    "confirm": true,
    "customer_id": "cus_abc_123",
    "authentication_type": "no_three_ds",
    "mandate_id": "<mandate_id>",
    "off_session": true
}'
```
````

## FAQ:

### **1. Does Hyperswitch support Automatic recurring payments/subscriptions at pre-defined intervals?**

No, Hyperswitch doesn't currently support automatic recurring payments at pre-defined intervals. This feature would be available soon under our Subscription module that is in development (Q1 2024). Until then, merchants can trigger recurring payments from their server by setting up the trigger schedules in their server.
