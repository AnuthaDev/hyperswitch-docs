### Step 2: [Create a payment](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/payments/payments--create) by sending payment\_link as true which will create a payment link with default payment\_link\_configs configs set in business profile update mentioned in Step 1

curl --location 'https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io/payments' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \

    "currency": "USD",
    "confirm": false,

    "description": "For selling Tshirt",
    "payment_link": true
}'
```

You can also customize a specific payment link by including the payment\_link\_config object while creating a link during [payments/create](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/payments/payments--create) call as well. Except for domain\_name field from the same object in business\_profile/update, you could customize the remaining fields.

```markup
curl --location 'https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io/payments' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--data '{

    "currency": "USD",
    "confirm": false,

}
}'
```



## FAQ?

### 1. Can I create a payment link pointing to my custom domain?

Yes. Your custom domain can be included in the default payment\_link\_config object as part of the business profile update.&#x20;

This involves adding CNAME records and TLS certificates which ends up being a slightly complex process. Please reach out to our [Support](https://join.slack.com/t/hyperswitch-io/shared\_invite/zt-1k6cz4lee-SAJzhz6bjmpp4jZCDOtOIg) to test this feature out with your custom domain.

### 2. Can I configure Payment links through Hyperswitch Control centre?

Currently, the Control centre's capability to create payment links is under development and will be available by Q1'24.
