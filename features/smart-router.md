## Prerequisites

To get started with  Smart Router , we need to have atleast one Payment Processor integrated . If no  payment processor have been integrated ,one can integrate any Payment Processor of their choice by following the [Connector Integration](../hyperswitch-cloud/connectors/) docs.

## No-code payments routing



While channelling payments across multiple processors on a daily basis is cumbersome, it could be vital to optimizing your payment processing costs as your business needs evolve constantly or as new payment processors provide competitive pricing and so on. Hence, Hyperswitchâ€™s Smart Router is designed as a no-code tool to provide complete control and transparency in creating and modifying payment routing rules. Hyperswitch supports below formats of Smart Routing.

**Volume Based Configuration:** Define volume distribution among multiple payment processors using percentages.

**Rule Based Configuration:** More granular control which allows to define custom routing logics based on different parameters of payment.

**Default Fallback Routing :** If the active routing rules are not applicable, the priority order of all configured payment processors is used to route payments. This priority order is configurable from the Dashboard.

**Cost Based Configuration (coming soon):** Automatically routes transaction to the payment processor charging the least MDR (merchant discount rate) for the opted payment method.

## How does the Smart Router work?

Hyperswitch Smart Router Engine evaluates every payment request against your predefined routing logic and makes a decision on the best payment processor for the payment, and executes the transaction. If the payment fails or if the payment processor is down, the payment is automatically retried through a different processor.

## How to configure the Smart Router?

[Hyperswitch dashboard](https://app.hyperswitch.io/routing) provides a simple, intuitive UI to configure multiple Routing rules on your dashboard under the **Routing** tab. There are three routing rule formats that Hyperswitch currently supports.\

## Next step&#x20;

To test the Smart Router, after activating one rule  , we can make a Test Payment using the [Hyperswitch Dashboard ](https://app.hyperswitch.io/sdk)
