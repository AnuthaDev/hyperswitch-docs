## Modify and Experiment

While the Unified Checkout is pre-optimized for maximum conversions, Hyperswitch does not restrict you to stick to a one-size-fits-all approach. Using Hyperswitch SDK APIs, you get complete control over modifying the payment experience by,

* **Including new fields to the payment form:** Quickly adapting to use cases such as collecting billing addresses, or zip code as additional information, since you will have complete control of your payment experience.
* **Prioritizing payment methods:** You can make an impact on the payment mix or conversion rates by prioritizing/ promoting specific payment methods for your customers.
* **Switching themes and layouts of checkout page:** The Unified Checkout comes with a wide range of pre-designed themes and layouts which you can choose from.
