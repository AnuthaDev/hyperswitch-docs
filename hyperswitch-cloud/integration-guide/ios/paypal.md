PayPal seamlessly integrates with Hyperswitch, providing you with the flexibility to replace conventional payment forms whenever it is feasible and appropriate.

**Accept a payment using PayPal in your iOS app**

Add this line to your Podfile along with [hyperswitch pod](swift-with-node-backend.md):

```ruby
pod 'Braintree/PayPalNativeCheckout'
```
