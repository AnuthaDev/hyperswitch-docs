**Hyperswitch supports credit and debit card payments through all our payment processor connectors.** \
We accept cards from all major global and local card networks, such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners, Discover, JCB, Union Pay, etc. While Hyperswitch supports card payments in 135+ currencies and 150+ countries, each of these connectors and networks has limitations in terms of the number of countries and currencies they support.

Apart from regular one-time payments, Hyperswitch supports saving a card, recurring payments, and placing a hold for later capture.

### Integration Steps

1. Go to Hyperswitch dashboard and to connectors tab [here](https://app.hyperswitch.io/) and enable card.

### Saved Cards

You could use Hyperswitchâ€™s PCI Compliant secure vault to safely store your customersâ€™ card data and retrieve them when they return to pay on your website/app. In addition, our hyper SDK has a checkbox on the payment page that you can use to take customersâ€™ consent to store their card data. To try out the save cards feature through API, include either of the values for the `setup_future_usage` field in your Payments API request body. This feature comes with [Unified Checkout](https://hyperswitch.io/docs/sdkIntegrations/unifiedCheckoutWeb#unified-checkout).

### 1. Setup the server

#### 1.1 Install the `hyperswitch-node` library

Install the package and import it in your code

```js
$ npm install @juspay-tech/hyperswitch-node
```

#### 1.2 Create a customer and payment

Before creating a customer or payment, import the `hyperswitch-node` dependencies and initialize it with your API key. To get an API Key please find it here.

```js
const hyper = require("@juspay-tech/hyperswitch-node")(â€˜YOUR_API_KEYâ€™);
```

Add an endpoint on your server that creates the customer. Creating a customer will help save a card to its corresponding customer ID. Return the customer ID to the client.

```js
app.post("/create-customer", async (req, res) => {
  const { items } = req.body;
  const customer = await hyper.customers.create({
    description: "My First Test Customer",
    email: "johndoe@example.com",
  });
  res.send({
    customer: customer.id,
  });
});
```

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a Payment. Creating a Payment helps to establish the intent of the customer to start a payment. It also helps to track the customerâ€™s payment lifecycle, keeping track of failed payment attempts and ensuring the customer is only charged once. Return the `client_secret` obtained in the response to securely complete the payment on the client. Add in an extra parameter of `customer` to save the card for that particular customer.

```js
// Create a Payment with the order amount and currency
app.post("/create-payment", async (req, res) => {
  const { items } = req.body;

  // Create a PaymentIntent with the order amount and currency
  const paymentIntent = await hyper.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: 100,
    currency: "USD",
    automatic_payment_methods: {
      enabled: true,
    },
    payment_method_options: {
      card: {
        request_three_d_secure: "automatic",
      },
    },
    customer: "cus_4xmr0vzTfD7qvxiMTZ8P",
  });
  res.send({
    clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret,
  });
});

app.post("/create-payment", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const paymentIntent = await hyper.paymentIntents.create({
      amount: 100,
      currency: "USD",
      automatic_payment_methods: {
        enabled: true,
      },
      payment_method_options: {
        card: {
          request_three_d_secure: "automatic",
        },
      },
      customer: "cus_4xmr0vzTfD7qvxiMTZ8P",
    });
    // Send publishable key and PaymentIntent details to client
    res.send({
      clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(400).send({
      error: {
        message: err.message,
      },
    });
  }
});
```

Add an endpoint in the server to call the `listPaymentMethods` to send the customer ID. This will return you the payment information required to display saved cards by `HyperElement` through which that customer will be able to confirm their payment.

```js
app.post("/list-paymentmethods", async (req, res) => {
  const paymentMethods = await hyper.customers.listPaymentMethods(
    "cus_dOIqeb2odRbQ4ZQkiMo9",
    { type: "card" }
  );

  res.send({
    paymentMethods: paymentMethods,
  });
});
```

### 2. Build checkout page on the client

_Follow the integration steps of Unified Checkout_ [_here_](https://hyperswitch.io/docs/unifiedCheckoutWeb/) _for your respective stack_

#### 2.1 Pass the the `paymentMethods` data to `HyperElements`

```js
useEffect(() => {
    // Create PaymentIntent as soon as the page loads
    fetch("/list-paymentmethods", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    })
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        setCustomerPaymentMethods(data.customerPaymentMethods);
      });
  }, []);

let options = {
    //clientSecret,
    clientSecret,
    appearance: {
      theme: theme,
    },
    ...,
    customerPaymentMethods:customerPaymentMethods
  };
  <div className="App">
  {clientSecret && (
    <HyperElements options={options} hyper={hyperPromise}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </HyperElements>
  )}
</div>

```

Now follow the rest of the integration steps to enable Unified Checkout.

### Recurring Payments - Mandate through cards

Currently, Hyperswitch supports the creation of mandates for card transactions through the following payment processors: - Adyen - Checkout

### Placing a hold for later capture

By default, all payments are auto-captured during authorization in Hyperswitch, but you can choose to separate capture from authorization by manually capturing an authorized payment later. Setting the â€˜captureâ€™ field in payments/confirm API to â€˜manualâ€™ will block the stated amount on the customerâ€™s card without charging them. To charge the customer an amount equal to or lesser than the blocked amount, use the payments/capture endpoint with the relevant details.
