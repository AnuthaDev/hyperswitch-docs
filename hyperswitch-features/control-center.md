## Payment Operations

"Payment Operations" refers to the operation time and effort spent by businesses beyond the payment processing step to manage the entire lifecycle of payments. It is cross-functional responsibility and shared across various teams of your business which is responsible for Customer Experience, Finance and Business Growth.

And, as you begin to process payments through multiple payment processors, the complexity increases multifold, thereby increasing fixed costs and siphoning out mind share from focussing on the core business.

Below are some of the day-to-day use cases of payments operations across teams which could potentially extract significant bandwidth from focusing on your core business growth.

**Customer Experience Team**

* Issuing refunds to customers
* Proactive monitoring of failed refunds and delayed refunds
* Customer queries on double debits
* Customer queries on incomplete/ delayed payments

**Finance Team**

* Reconciliation of Payment Processed versus Amount Settled to Bank
* Timely submission of evidence for chargeback claims from customers
* Reducing the cost of fraud through monitoring
* Optimizing payment processing cost with Smart Routing
* Reporting across multiple business units / product lines
* Triggering bulk refunds

**Business Operations and Growth**

* Tracking, analyzing, and enhancing payment authorization rate
* Expanding to new markets and accepting new payment methods
* Product Returns versus Refunds issued to customers
* Reporting across multiple business units/ product lines

Inadequate attention to payment operations might negatively impact your Net Promoter Score and impact the growth of your business.
