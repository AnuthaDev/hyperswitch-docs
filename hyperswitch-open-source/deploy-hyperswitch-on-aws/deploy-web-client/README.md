# ðŸ–¥ Deploy web client

{% hint style="info" %}
In this chapter, you will host the web client on AWS cloud.&#x20;

Deploying web client consists of two main steps:

1. Deploy HyperLoader.js
2. Integrate the SDK on your app and deploy the app

For quick prototyping, you can also try out deploying the full stack integrated demo app playground.
{% endhint %}

This guide is aimed at helping you deploy the Web client on the cloud and access it over the internet.

1. Production ready deployment of web client: At the end of this step, you will host the web client SDK (HyperLoader.js) on the cloud to serve your customers. &#x20;
2. Integrate on your app and deploy: Once HyperLoader.js is deployed on cloud, you can integrate the SDK in your web app. You can deploy this as a part of your regular deployment.
3. Deploying the playground for quick prototyping **(OPTIONAL)**: The web client comes with a full stack playground for quick prototyping. You can test the deployment with a single script and get a feel of the product before you integrate it on your app.
