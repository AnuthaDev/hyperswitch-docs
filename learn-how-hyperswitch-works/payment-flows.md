# ðŸŒŠ Payment flows

{% hint style="info" %}
This chapter will cover the payment flows available with Hyperswitch. Please reach out to us to learn more about the payment flows supported!
{% endhint %}

## **Payments flow**

There are multiple stages in a Payment flow depending on the payment methods that are involved. Considering an one-time payment method where there was no redirection involved, the following stages form the Payment flow:

**a) Creating a Payment:** When your customer wants to checkout, create a payment by hitting the payments/create endpoint. Fetch and store the payment\_id and client\_secret

**b) Loading the SDK:** After your customer checks out, load the Hyperswitch SDK by initiating it with the client\_secret and publishable\_key

**c) SDK being rendered:** After you initiate the SDK, the SDK makes several API calls involving the /sessions and /payment\_methods endpoints to load relevant payment methods and any saved cards associated with the customer

**d) Customer enters the payment method data:** After the SDK is fully rendered, your customer would choose a payment method and enter the relevant information and click pay

**e) Confirming the payment:** After the customer clicks pay, the SDK calls the payments/confirm endpoint with the customer's payment method details and post response, it displays the payment status

## **What are `PaymentIntent` and `PaymentAttempt` objects and how do they work in Hyperswitch?**

Hyperswitch uses the `PaymentIntent` object to track the status of a payment initiated by you. Since, Hyperswitch enables retrying a single payment multiple times across different processors until a successful transaction, we track each of these payment attempts through separate `PaymentAttempt` objects.

While `PaymentIntent` and `PaymentAttempt` have their own state machines, the various states in `PaymentAttempt` are also constrained by their respective mapping to the `PaymentIntent` statuses.

**PaymentIntent state machine:**&#x20;

The following is an abridged version of the `PaymentIntent` state machine flow that covers majority of the above payment use-cases.

}
  }
}%%
